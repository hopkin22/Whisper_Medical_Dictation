# Whisper_Medical_Dictation
Whisper Open AI as an offline means for medical transcription using MAC and apple recordings to streamline note writing.

Install Whisper using github:
pip install git+https://github.com/openai/whisper.git 

otherwise requirements.txt should function. Will need to download large-v2 model once downloaded.
